# # GitLab CI Job Configuration
#
# Goal: Run all jobs defined here on all available runners (GNU/Linux and
# Windows).
# 
# Procedure: Use GitLab job templates in ".gitlab/ci/templates/" and use them
# in the job description by using the "extend" keyword.
#
# ## Job Description Syntax
#
# <job_name>:                   # Job name which is displayed in web interface.
#   stage: <stage_name>         # Run "script" commands in this stage. The
#                               # stages are exececuted sequentially.
#   script:
#      - <arbitrary_commands>   # Here you can execute arbitratry terminal
#                               # commands. If any of the commands return a
#                               # non-zero exit code, the job fails.
