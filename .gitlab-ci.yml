  # Following syntaxes allow you to skip whole classes and single methods:

  #   #Exclude one test class
  #   mvn test -Dtest=!LegacyTest
  #   # Exclude one test method
  #   mvn verify -Dtest=!LegacyTest#testFoo
  #   # Exclude two test methods
  #   mvn verify -Dtest=!LegacyTest#testFoo+testBar
  #   # Exclude a package with a wildcard (*)
  #   mvn test -Dtest=!com.mycompany.app.Legacy*
